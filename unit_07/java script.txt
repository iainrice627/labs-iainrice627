java script


really struggling 


stuck trying to make cointainers change individually when they are touched by a mouse or mouse leaves.


ive been restricting myself to the examples given in labs but its not working. I need to re-do the videos and do it along with computer. 

I need to investigate 

varible intialising and why I need them
I need to think about for loop to do the job


the issue is each continaer is unique qith separate colours. cant mass change them easily. 

so trying to avoid repeating a formula for each one.
