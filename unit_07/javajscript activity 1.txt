javajscript activity 1


trying to change colour of divs with mouseover function.


	document.getElementById("id1").document.addEventListener("mouseover", onmouseover);   

    	function onmouseover() {
        	document.getElementById('id1').style.backgroundColor = 'orange';  
    	}


	document.getElementById("id1").document.addEventListener("mouseout", outmouseover);

    	function outmouseover(){
        	document.getElementById('id1').style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
          
    	}  



EEROR - trying to use the addEventListener method on an object that is undefined.


you need to define the object in javascript

	const id1 = document.getElementById('id1');


you then need to add the event to the thing you want to change. the mistake you made was to assign document, because you wanted just the element. 

	const id1 = document.getElementById('id1');id1.addEventListener()


you then need to say what you want to happen in the () next to event listener. i.e. a function

	const id1 = document.getElementById("id1");id1.addEventListener("mouseover", onmouseover); 


the function is then written, we are calling in onmouseover but this also something else. could be anything.

	function onmouseover()


then write in the code for what is going to happen.

		{
		document.getElementById('id1').style.backgroundColor = 'orange';
		}


it will get id1, access(.), the background colour, make it(=) oranage. 

 
//each of the 8 need their own id = id2, id3, id4----> id9.

//i could copy and past the above and assign new code to each.

//what needs to happen
    // each id needs to be defined. with 
    //  const x = document.getElementById("x");x.addEventListner("mouseover", on mouseover);

// which is the value that needs to change. x.  it needs to increment becasye in html each div will be incrementating 1-8.

const x = ["id1","id2","id3","id4","id5","id6","id7","id8"];
