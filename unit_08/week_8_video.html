<!-- introduction to jQuery and json -->


<!-- jQuery is a javascript library 
 
JS is a programming language
jq is a js library, built on top of js

can access and create DOM faster than JS

must include Jquery in URL header of the webpage - what does this look like.
but JS has been built into browsers now.  this means that jquery is like a css framework you link for. it is somewhere else.


jquery 

to find html elements by ID - use - $("#myID)"); rather than document.getElementByID("myID");

html tag - use - $("a");



find nested HTML elements by tag - in js need to use two lines for nested element.

  eg let x = document.getElementbyTagName("main");
            let y = x.getElementsbyTagName("p");

do you have nested elements in your html. what does an html nested element look like?

elements can contain other elements. Elements inside of other elements are called nested elements. https://simpledev.io/lesson/nested-elements-html-1/

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>


see if you can figure out lab 8 using this.

the jquery = $("main p");   main is the parent. but can put anything in eg class etc, as long as it is the parent.


jquery does not replace JS.  it just makes it simpler

JSON

main way to interacte with API - whaty isd API?

Objects

arrays

values

json combines them to be readinble by humans and machiness

object = unordered set of key value pairs.

begins {}

{ KEY : VALUE }
{ KEY : VALUE , KEY : VALUE} if want to add more than one key value pairs.

arrays

[ VALUE ]

[ VALUE, VALUE ]

VALUES

"STRING"
NUMBER
TRUE/FALSE
NULL
ARRAY

YOU CAN HAVE A NUMBER SHOWN IN A STRING OR TRUE AND FALSE

--#

main sytax we use to get anything from a webservice

it is text and then trasnlate into json format

example

a JS object  "Sammy" with some profile information

{"sammy" : {"username" : "SammyShark","locatoin" : "indian ocean","online" : "True"," followers" : 987}    }         

   KEY   : VALUE 
   
   But here thee value is multiple values

            { KEY : VALUE, KEY: VALUE, KEY:VALUE, KEY:VALUE, KEY:VALUE}
SO ITS

{KEY :  {KEY:VALUE, KEY:VALUE, KEY:VALUE, KEY:VALUE, KEY:VALUE}}


EASH OBJECT IS A JSON OBJECT

{
object 1
 "sammy" : {
    "username" : "SammyShark",      STRING
    "locatoin" : "indian ocean",    STRING
    "online" : "True",              BOOLEAN
    " followers" : 987              NUMBER 
 }
object 2
"BOB" : {
    "username" : "BOBShark",      STRING
    "locatoin" : "indian ocean",    STRING
    "online" : "FASLE",              BOOLEAN
    " followers" : 1987              NUMBER 
    "WEBSITES": [{"description" :"work", "URL" : "https:// address.com/"}, {description" :"work", "URL" : "https:// address.com/"}]
       KEY    : VALUE

       KEY    : [ { KEY : VALUE, KEY: VALUE} , {KEY:VALUE,KEY:VALUE} ]  in this array, the list is the value with multiple things in it. each thing is contained in {} with their own multiple things.

       ie one webstie has two things, but there are two webites in the array.
        website is the object.
        
    }

}
