how use javascript to interact without outisde services or applications and data of other websites.
Application program interfaces

restful web services - how work 
JS obect N JSON - how we get any API informtion

asynchronous communcication - hwo computers communiciate

fetch - way to implemnent in js

-----


api - routines guidelines, rules for how to interact with other software.
gets info, 

web api - thinking about data want and how it given to us. 

http web request message.


soap approach - uses xml. very structured
rest approach - more open to interpretation - more expermineta;. json - gives more freedom.
its most lused in social media.

so when would soap be used?

need good understanding of java script to do this.

------


restful services.

theory - way systems commincate.

eg amaxon uses restful to create applications

principles

- seperation of client and server. data stored and clients access. assists with portability and scalabilty.
        make sure clietn and server are seperate entitites
        model view controller 
        client only needs accestto resource uri that it needs to not whoel system. 
        can pull our servers and pull out clients. or insert different ones and use the same api.


- stateless - stateless interaction - server doesnt need to know what did previoulsy. no history in place. 
        client will tell server everything needs to know to ghive corect infor eg login or i need acces to this user data
        if statefull it beceomes process heacyv. better to off load processing to client.



- cacheable - save any data from restful service, to wil be correct ofr now or long period of time. eg weather website - needs to chnage. not cacheable. browers needs to know what to keep and get rid of
        need to declare what should be saved or deleted at set time.

- uniform interfdace - very structered way to get acces to information.  
        anythime interacting with api should be able to inte4ract with the same methods
        common key words - eg get. 


- layered system - hierachical structure in place. 
        data being shown ot user, only seeing what need to see, dont need to know backend, eg data of server is in one country etc.
        jsut care about the single layer they can access.



rest maturity model- - richardson

level 0 - 3 pyramid model.

key terms - uri, verbs, HATEOS

URI - web address. 

can use verbs to acces diffewrnt site adress

get post put delete.  
can send stuff to api through post.  

for now jsut using get to do stuff.

HATEOAS - hyopermedia as the engine of apllication states.

anythink that contains a link to other informaiton

if we are pulling info from api we expect to get additional information from api that we can do sesnisbly fromt hat location.

eg pulling back infor from admin departement. name of department etc  the hateos provides links which gives more infor abput how api works. eg emplyee links gives more infor about employees.



check stack over flow to see if there are lots of questions about a particularly api.
make sure the api has active giuthub community. the errors can be worked out already. 


level 0 = uri and single verb ie get.

level 1 - we can also use multiple uri   - we will proabbly just stay here at this level.

level 2 - we can get multiple verbs to do things

level 3 hateoas.



check what level the api is at ie you wil focus on apis that are at level 0 and 1. not possible to use level 0 api in level 3 way. but can use level 3 api in level 0 way.

------------------------------


asychronous communication

synchronous - happens in real life. immediate communication.  you listen and do nothing inbetweeen.
asynchonous - not happening in real time - ie emails.  deopends on whther someone sees it. you do thingsi n between waiting for repsonse. 

sychronpoue exapmple -clinet - sends request, waits until server sends repsonse.
asyncrhonpue - client sends reuest - confirm the arrival then later send repsonse and the server sends confirmation and ewaits againto send other inofrmation.

these both have places so need to kwo when to use them,

eg email would be bad in sychronous.

the request response que. 

12 stages of communciation between serviers client and ques.  trying to reduce computation. 

it is implentaed in JS using Js promises

return value - yes you wil get this inofrmation or no not get this informaiotn. client can then do other thigns knowing soemthing will arrive or not. 
success call back  or failure call back

PROMOSES - see JS opage

-------
JSON

keyu features - objects, arrays values (remmerb key value pairs.)

objects

unordered set of key value pairs

{Key:Value}

use comman between objects

{Key:Value},{Key:Value}

aarays ordered collections of vlauies


{Key:[{Value},{Value}]}



---

information can only be sent to us as text. can convert to json format. 

eg we have json objects in json file (look at early lessons for example)

in the arrays you can see more information - ehg description url within an object called person.

use JSON as a method to commuicate with servers. thje main sytax/language we see.

need to take it and use it in our services.

------------

using fetch API

fetch ()

its built into JS.  works on idea of promises

xml http request method.  

modern web browsers use fetch. not supported in older browsers. can i use service can hlep you figure out what works.

how does fetch work?

--------------------------


to put into action

create html and construct the elements

eg title. using cards so need elements for the bootstrap card code to style. 

can you remmebers

div eelemnt
